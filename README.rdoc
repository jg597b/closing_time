== README

Create a Ruby on Rails App to manage open and close times for different locations. The app
should have:
* Users CRUD
* Locations CRUD with open and close time for each day of the week
* User login
* API RestFull to check if a location is open or close
Besides, create a HTML page that shows some content if a location is open or not
Everything else is up to you
Weâ€™ll evaluate, among other things:
* Clean and readable code
* Gems used
* Comment code
* Tests
* User interface
* Time management

You have a maximum of 3 hours to do this.
To review we need you to upload your code to a github repository.
Have fun :)
